# The Genesis Gambit

## Overview

The Genesis Gambit is a card game that features a twist on deck-building, where instead of building a deck you build a “deck” of pack types from which you draft at the start of every game.

## Influences

- TTCCG’s
  - The Genesis Gambit is a TTCCG at its core, with mechanics altered intended to reduce the focus on “collecting”.
- Nertz Online
  - Nertz is a core influence for The Genesis Gambit, as its fast-paced nature is novel to the TTCCG genre.
- TIS100 / Molek Syntez
  - The Genesis Gambit’s visual style is inspired by these games. The main goal is to have something we can reasonably achieve that doesn’t look half-baked.

## Unique Selling Point

Most games in the TTCCG genre feature turn-based action. None that I know of have realtime, fast-paced gameplay.
